== What Needs Do'in

* These probably need to be in with build-scripts:
    - system_files: []  # the system files potetnially effected (like etc/*)
    - distributions: [debian]  # the distributions it si KNOWN to work for

* README are confusing. At the moment you need to read/skip though
  four pages of text, and still purpose are unclear.
  When reading the first 10-20 lines of a document, I expect to
  know the purpose of it.

* separate installation notes from README to a seperate file
  (INSTALL). So that README become more understandable.

* README should also mention the current status and state of the
  project.

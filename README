= Baker, The Delicious Program Maker

== What is It?

Baker is a source-based package management system
(although it can handle binary packages too).
It is 100% well structed OO Ruby code, which can easily be extended
and called upon as a library. Its commandline interface called 'bake'
makes it easy to download, compile and install programs.
A catalog of &quot;recipes&quot; (also called the &quot;recipe book&quot;)
can be sync'd with a master (or mirrored master) and contains yaml files
that describe where to get a program (handles mirrors and local regions),
how to compile it and how to install it. Thus it is easily suited
to any distribution, even those with non-standard FHS.
It is quite flexible, having extensible types of build recipes, already
including a basic shell recipe class. Shell recipes simply runs yaml embedded
shell scripts for each stage, subsequent to package download and extraction).
We are working on "smarter" make recipes handling compilation semi-automatically
augmented with yaml embedded build options. It also automatically handles
dependencies and conflicts. The goal of the project is to offer
open operating systems an easy means to manage large
collections of packages. Most of the system is functional,
but some aspects (mainly the smart-mode) are still being designed.

Note: a few of these features are still subject to alteration.

== Inspiration

Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake,
Baker's man!
So I do, master,
As fast as I can.

Pat it, and prick it,
And mark it with T,
Put it in the oven
For Tommy and me.

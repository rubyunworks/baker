EXTERNAL FILE NOTES

These are external libs and files that Baker needs to work or are useful
for reference. If required they are provided here b/c they either
have some minor alteration made to them, or for your convenience.

Required
--------

open-uri.rb - Modified for progress bar hook. this cahnge is being integrated into
              the official version by Tanaka once he figures out the "best" implementation.

progressbar - A small change was made to this to allow for external alteration of the
              bar symbol, which was a static |ooooooo|, but I prefered the |>>>>>>| :)

To install these move open-uri.rb to you ruby/1.8 installation directory
(probably /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/ or /usr/local/lib/ruby/1.8/). You will overwrite the
file already there. You may back it up just in case.

Copy progressbar directory in full to ruby/site-ruby/1.8 (similiar to above locations).

That's it.

<div class="description"><h1><a href="../classes/Baker.html">Baker</a>, The Delicious Program Maker</h1>
<h2>REQUIREMENTS</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ruby 1.8+

</li>
<li>Patch of open-uri.rb (Included)

</li>
<li>Patched version of Progressbar (Also Included)

</li>
<li>Cohonas :) Hey, it&#8217;s still beta!

</li>
</ul>
<h2>INSTALLING</h2>
<p>
There is no automated installed yet.
</p>
<h3>For Developers</h3>
<ol>
<li>Don&#8216;t move anything! <a href="../classes/Baker.html">Baker</a> can be
configured to look wherever you need it to, so we can point it to look for
everything in your working CVS directory. That way you can test your
changes easily and you don&#8217;t have to do anything special.

<p>
The other option is to place links in the places were a normal end user
would have the <a href="../classes/Baker.html">Baker</a> files (see below)
and configure <a href="../classes/Baker.html">Baker</a> to follow those.
It&#8217;s your choice. Maikng links is a little more work though. (BTW if
more then one user planes to use the same receipe repository then you will
need to move that to a central location.)
</p>
</li>
<li>The main thing is to set the environment variable
BAKERETC=/path/to/your/cvs/working/dir/baker/etc. be sure to export it and
add it to you ~/.profile file or the master /etc/profile file so it is
automatically set the next time you boot.

<p>
From here on we&#8217;ll call you cvs path /=(cvspath). So the above would
then be /=(cvspath)/baker/etc.
</p>
</li>
<li>Be sure your EDITOR environment variable is also set to your favorite
editor. EDITOR=vim for example.

</li>
<li>Now we need to edit a few config files to let baker know where everyting
is.

<pre>
  &gt; cd /=(cvspath)/baker/etc
</pre>
<p>
and edit the cat-config file. The first line probably looks like this,
</p>
<pre>
 recipe_dir: '/home/transami/Files/Source/ruby/baker/var/cat'
</pre>
<p>
Change it to,
</p>
<pre>
  recipe_dir: '/=(cvspath)/baker/var/cat'
</pre>
</li>
<li>Now we need to do the same thing to the current and default build configs.

<pre>
  &gt; cd build
</pre>
<p>
You will see 3 files. current, default, undo. In both the default and
current files change these lines,
</p>
<pre>
  source_dirpath: '/home/transami/Files/Programs/Ruby/Baker/var/baker/src/%s/%s'
  work_dirpath: '/home/transami/Files/Programs/Ruby/Baker/var/baker/fooroot/%s/%s'
</pre>
<p>
in the same manner,
</p>
<pre>
  source_dirpath: '/=(cvspath)/baker/src/%s/%s'
  work_dirpath: '/=(cvspath)/baker/fooroot/%s/%s'
</pre>
<p>
Actually the last one dosen&#8217;t do anything yet, and will probably
change. But go ahead and do anyway for now. The two %s represent where the
program name and version number will be substitued. So what happens is,
when you tell baker to fetch a program, it will place the source in the
dir,
</p>
<pre>
  /=(cvspath)/baker/src/program-name/program-version/'
</pre>
</li>
<li>Almost there. You will need to go to the ext dir.

<pre>
  &gt; cd /=(cvspath)/baker/ext
</pre>
<p>
There you will find some extras. You can read the file EXT-NOTES for
additional info.
</p>
<p>
The open-uri.rb ruby file is a replacement for the open-uri.rb file in your
ruby installation. Probably in /usr/local/lib/ruby/1.8/. You will need to
replace the one there with this one. You might want to backup the old one
just in case.
</p>
<p>
You also need to move the progressbar directory to your site_ruby dir,
probably /usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/.
</p>
</li>
<li>Finally make two links in the appropriate bin directories to bake.rb and
bake-config.rb, called bake and bake-config, respectively. Something like
this:

<pre>
   &gt; ln -s /=(cvspath)/baker/src/baker.rb /usr/local/bin/baker
   &gt; ln -s /=(cvspath)/baker/src/baker-config.rb /usr/local/bin/baker-config

 GoboUsers, you know what to do.
</pre>
</li>
<li>That should be it! If you have toruble read the End User section for some
additioanl info, or give me an email: transami@runbox.com. If all wnt well
skip to the next section.

</li>
</ol>
<h3>For End Users</h3>
<ol>
<li>This Procedure is similiar to the above except we will be moving
directories to there &quot;proper&quot; places in your file system.

<p>
PLEASE NOTE: This procedure is not complete and is slightly out of date.
</p>
</li>
<li>In the unpacked baker directory you will see 4 directories etc, ext, src,
var. Plus a few extra files, like this <a href="README.html">README</a> and
the license info in <a href="COPYING.html">COPYING</a>. You will want to
move the etc directory to your main configuration directorey, probably
/etc, and rename it baker. From the unpacked dir:

<pre>
  &gt; mv etc /etc/baker
</pre>
<p>
For more experienced users, you can of course put this wherever you&#8217;d
like and create links to suit &#8212;or baker can be configured to look
where you want it too. GoboLinux users will of course move this dir to
/Programs/<a href="../classes/Baker.html">Baker</a>/Settings.
</p>
</li>
<li>In a shell console set the environment variable BAKERETC to the path of the
settings directory you just moved. Probably do:

<pre>
  &gt; BAKERETC=/etc/Baker; export BAKERETC
</pre>
<p>
You will want to add this line to your personal ~/.profile file or to the
master profile file, probably in /etc/profile, so that it will be set the
next time you boot your computer.
</p>
</li>
<li>Now copy the src directory to your site_ruby/1.8 directory, probably
/usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/ or some such nonsense :), and rename it to
baker as well.

<pre>
  &gt; mv src /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/baker
</pre>
<p>
For GoboLinux users rename it to <a href="../classes/Baker.html">Baker</a>
and move it to /Programs, and add a link in
/Programs/Ruby/1.8/lib/site_ruby/ back to /Programs/<a
href="../classes/Baker.html">Baker</a> called baker. (At least I think
that&#8217;s the proper way.)
</p>
</li>
<li>You will need to create a new directory for the recipe catalog. On a
typical system a good place for this is /var/baker/recipes. GoboLinux users
probably will want it in /Files/ProgramRecipes. Again <a
href="../classes/Baker.html">Baker</a> is configurable, so you can put it
anywhere else you&#8217;d like.

</li>
<li>Then cd to /etc/baker (or where ever you decided to put the settings
directory) and you will see a file Ccat-config, and two folders: build and
templates.

</li>
<li>Edit cat-config with your favorite editor.

</li>
<li>This file is in Yaml format. Just looking at this file carefully will teach
you most of the Yaml syntax. But Yaml is used extensively by <a
href="../classes/Baker.html">Baker</a> so it&#8217;s a good idea to go to
<a href="http://www.yaml.org">www.yaml.org</a> and learn more. By the way,
never change the frist line! This tells <a
href="../classes/Baker.html">Baker</a> what kind of file this is. Right now
it&#8217;s tied to Ruby, the language <a
href="../classes/Baker.html">Baker</a> is implemented in, this will be made
generic in the future.

</li>
<li>You will see a line labeled recipe_dir: After this put in the directory
path to the catalog directory you created in step 5. Make sure there is a
space after the colon (:) and that there is no slash (/) at the end of the
path name.

</li>
<li>Finally make two links in the appropriate bin directories to bake.rb and
bake-config.rb, called bake and bake-config, respectively. Something like
this:

<pre>
  &gt; ln -s /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/baker/baker.rb /usr/bin/baker
  &gt; ln -s /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/baker/baker.rb /usr/bin/baker
</pre>
<p>
GoboUsers, you know what to do.
</p>
</li>

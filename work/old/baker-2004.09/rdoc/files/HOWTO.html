<div class="description"><h1><a href="../classes/Baker.html">Baker</a>, The Delicious Program Maker</h1>
<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>
From the outside <a href="../classes/Baker.html">Baker</a> consists command
line command called &#8216;bake&#8217; which provides a complete interface
for the compilation of programs and maintenance of source package
information. This information is refered to as a <b>recipe</b>. Every
program and version of that program, you wish to compile needs a recipe.
You can easily create you own recipes, and maintain your own recipe
repository, or download <b>catalogs</b> of recipes from other repositories
available over the internet.
</p>
<p>
It is important to understand, that while <a
href="../classes/Baker.html">Baker</a> itself is distribution independent,
recipes may not be! A Recipe contains a listing of the distributions it is
known to support. But even if your distribution is not listed, it does not
neccessarily mean the receipe won&#8217;t work, but only that the recipe
maintainer either does not know, or is working only on recipes for a
particular distribution. This issue is usually not of great concern,
becasue on the whole, catalogs of recipes will be designated for a specific
distribution. The dream of a universal repository is sadly still some ways
off. But <a href="../classes/Baker.html">Baker</a> is working on it!
</p>
<p>
Please keep in mind that these instructions neccessarily lag behind the
actual implmenation. We update them as fast as we can, but expect to find
some descrepencies. Please lets us know when you do. Thanks.
</p>
<h2>PREPING THE OVEN</h2>
<p>
IF you completed the <a href="INSTALL.html">INSTALL</a>, the you&#8217;re
ready to get started. First thing we need to do is set up a few parameters
called a Build Configuration. If everything is set up properly you shoud be
able to do:
</p>
<pre>
  % bake-config show
</pre>
<p>
And it will show you the current build configuration. If it instead tells
you it can&#8217;t find the configuration file then somethings wrong with
the setup. Try to figure out what went wrong. If you need help contact me.
</p>
<p>
If all is well, you will see something like this:
</p>
<pre>
  --- !ruby/object:Baker::BuildConfig
  source_dirpath: '/home/transami/Files/Programs/Ruby/Baker/var/baker/src/%s/%s'
  work_dirpath: '/home/transami/Files/Programs/Ruby/Baker/var/baker/fooroot/%s/%s'
  local_region: North America
  host: i686
  target: i686
  cflags: []
  check: true
  concurrent_threads: 1
  cxxflags: []
  distcc: true
  kernel_config: ''
  strip: false
  thread_library: nptl
  prefix: /usr/local
  man_dirpath: ''
  info_dirpath: ''
  avoid: [ 'tk' ]
  ensure: []
</pre>
<p>
Boy! Oh, boy! Dosen&#8216;t that look fun! :) So the most important thing
for you to adjust here are the source_dirpath, which tells <a
href="../classes/Baker.html">Baker</a> where to keep the source files it
downloads, and also the host and target fields, which tell <a
href="../classes/Baker.html">Baker</a> what cpu architecture you&#8217;re
running and will compile. The prefix field too is useful to generally tell
where programs will be installed. For instance, GobLinux users should put
/Programs here.
</p>
<p>
To see what kind of architectures that <a
href="../classes/Baker.html">Baker</a> supports type:
</p>
<pre>
  % bake-config arch
</pre>
<p>
If you have doubts then use &#8216;i386&#8217;, which will work for all
Intel-compatible machines.
</p>
<p>
To edit this file type:
</p>
<pre>
  % bake-config edit
</pre>
<p>
If your EDITOR enviornment variable is set to you favorite editor then you
can edit the build config. If not then first set your EDITOR environment
variable, and try again.
</p>
<p>
Let go over each of these and what they are for:
</p>
<pre>
  NOTE: The build config might need these, not sure yet.
          cc: 'gcc'
          cpp: '????'
          ldflags: []
        I've included them below just in case.
</pre>
<ul>
<li>source_dirpath:: This tells <a href="../classes/Baker.html">Baker</a> where
to keep the source files it downloads.

</li>
<li>local_region:: This is the location of your computer. It should be North
America, South America, Europe, Australia, Asia, or Unspecified.

</li>
<li>host:: This is you cpu architecture of the machine you are running <a
href="../classes/Baker.html">Baker</a>.

</li>
<li>target:: This is you cpu architecture you will be compiling for.

</li>
<li>cc:: The c/c++ compiler command.

</li>
<li>cpp:: The c/c++ preprocessor command.

</li>
<li>cflags:: These are special c/c++ flags to be passed to the compiler.

</li>
<li>cppflags:: These are special c/c++ flags to be passed to the preprocessor.
(eg. -I)

</li>
<li>ldflags:: These are special library flags to be passed to the compiler.
(eg. -L)

</li>
<li>concurrent_threads:: The number of parallel build jobs to do at once. (NOT
YET WORKING)

</li>
<li>check:: Be sure to do a make check.

</li>
<li>distcc:: This is either true or false and determines if &#8230;

</li>
<li>strip:: This is either true or false and determines if debugging info
should be stripped from the compiled code.

</li>
<li>thread_library:: The thread library to use. This can be either
&#8216;nptl&#8217; or &#8216;linuxthreads&#8217;.

</li>
<li>kernel_config:: The path to you kernal configuration.

</li>
<li>prefix:: The main part of the path to where programs are to be installed.
Usually /usr or /usr/local

</li>
<li>man_dirpath:: The path to man documentation on your system.

</li>
<li>info_dirpath:: The path to info documentation on your system.

</li>
<li>avoid:: This is a list of program &quot;use&quot; names for compliment
program support that should be avioded as program add-ons.

</li>
<li>ensure:: This designates the &quot;use&quot; names for supplement progam
support that should be included as program add-ons.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you don&#8217;t understand all of this, don&#8217;t worry I don&#8217;t
either :) But it will become clearer as we continue.
</p>
<p>
To see what else you can do with the bake-config command line program type,
</p>
<pre>
  % bake-config help
</pre>
<p>
You will notice that you have some pretty good options for storing mutiple
configurations.
</p>
<h2>BAKE ME A CAKE!</h2>
<p>
Now lets do some real baking. First of all we will skip synronizing with a
master recipe repository because none currently exist. (<a
href="../classes/Baker.html">Baker</a> is brand new remember! But you can
help!) So lets look at creating your own recipes.
</p>
<p>
The recipe catalog directory that we created earlier contains the recipe
files, also in Yaml format, with names in the form of:
Program&#8212;Version. So for example, my-program&#8212;1.0. We keep
seperate recipes for different versions b/c sometimes various important
aspects change from version to version. Lets create a new recipe. We can
easily do this by typing
</p>
<pre>
  % bake new simple MyProgram 1.0
</pre>
<p>
This creates a new SimpleRecipe (the only kind we have so far) and names it
MyProgram&#8212;1.0, and places it in the your personal recipe catalog.
</p>
<p>
PLEASE NOTE: There&#8217;s a good chance this still has bug or two b/c
I&#8217;m still working on the exact details of storing the recipes.
Technically personal recipes should be stored in you home directory, but
for now they are going directly into /=(cvspath)/baker/var/cat/. If you
look in there you will see that is a test directory. That&#8217;s the test
repository. You can have multiple repositories.
</p>
<p>
A good test test at this point is to do
</p>
<pre>
  % bake find M
</pre>
<p>
And you should see MyProgram&#8212;1.0 listed. Now to work on it we type:
</p>
<pre>
  % bake edit MyProgram 1.0
</pre>
<p>
And again with EDITOR set, our favorite editor will load up the recipe
which will look like this pretend example:
</p>
<pre>

</pre>
<p>
Most of this will be farily obvious. There are only a few things we need to
directly address, before we get into the actual script writing.
</p>
<p>
First catagories is nothing special, just put what you think fits, but make
some effort to be consistanct with what others might put. Good ones are QT,
KDE, GTK, Gnome, and Mesa, as well as basic subjects like: Office, Math,
Internet, Security and so on.
</p>
<p>
Super is the name of the RecipeCollection this recipe belongs, if it
belongs to any. For example there are an number of programs that would be a
part of the Gnome&#8212;2.4 RecipeCollection, and in fact these are further
subdived into collections like GnomeOffice&#8212;2.4.
</p>
<p>
Dependencies are other recipes that this one require to do a complete
build.
</p>
<p>
Conlficts are other recipes that won&#8217;t work with this one. This is
related to <a
href="../classes/Baker/Manager.html#M000070">install_conflicts</a>, but
that one is for already installed programs. This one is just for recipes
that the user might try to compile together or include in a collection.
</p>
<p>
Compliment are programs that will be included with this program, unless the
program name is specifically listed in the avoid list in the build config
being used. (Doesn&#8216;t apply if you use the -i ooption which ignores
all dependencies and such, not recommended) Suppliment are programs that
will NOT be added in unless the program name is included in the ensure list
in the current build condig.
</p>
<p>
Programs are given in full using recipename&#8212;version. An optional + is
added to mean any version greater than this. <a
href="../classes/Baker.html">Baker</a> will always look for the higest
version it can when the + is given.
</p>
<p>
The no_architecture list gives the cpus the program can&#8217;t be compiled
on.
</p>
<p>
Oh, install_indicators. This is a list of file paths that would indicate
that this program has been installed. <a
href="../classes/Baker.html">Baker</a> looks for these files to determine
this so be sure to consider this carefully. Notice the last one in this
list. That a special seach form. The first part is the root dir to search
the second is grep expression for the remainder of the path anf an remaonig
word are directories off the root to prune (i.e. not search) This turns out
to be slow as crap. So it will probably be removed.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="../classes/Baker/Manager.html#M000070">install_conflicts</a>
are the same. The list paths to files that would indicate this program is
going to have a problem.
</p>
<p>
The system_files is a list of system files that the installer will change.
For example the installer maight add an entry to /etc/profile. In that case
that file should be listed here.
</p>
<p>
Right now these paths are absolute, we will be making them relative soon.
</p>
<p>
The xxx_script fields are actually scripts that are excuted to do those
jobs. These will usually be shell scripts, but the can be Ruby or Perl,
etc. too. /=(var) are used in them to substitue certain values from this
file and the current build config.
</p>

<h2>END NOTES</h2>
<p>
These instructions are far from complete and the program itself is still
going through a number of changes, so at this point expect to contribute to
devleopment if you wish to use <a href="../classes/Baker.html">Baker</a>.
</p>
<p>
If all goes as planned, it won&#8217;t be long before we will have the most
robust, the only truly distro nuetral, and certaily the most delicious,
source package manager in the world :)

<div class="description"><h1><a href="../classes/Baker.html">Baker</a>, The Delicious Program Maker</h1>
<h2><a href="ABOUT.html">ABOUT</a></h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Baker.html">Baker</a> is an advanced source-based
package management system (although it can handle binary packages too). It
is 100% well structed OO Ruby code, which can easily be extended and called
upon as a library. Its commandline interface called &#8216;bake&#8217;
makes it easy to download, compile and install programs. A catalog of
&amp;quot;recipes&amp;quot; (also called the &amp;quot;recipe
book&amp;quot;) can be sync&#8217;d with a master (or mirrored master) and
contains yaml files that describe where to get a program (handles mirrors
and local regions), how to compile it and how to install it. Thus it is
easily suited to any distribution, even those with non-standard FHS. It is
quite flexible, having extensible types of build recipes, already including
a basic shell recipe class. Shell recipes simply runs yaml embedded shell
scripts for each stage, subsequent to package download and extraction). We
are working on &quot;smarter&quot; make recipes handling compilation
semi-automatically augmented with yaml embedded build options. It also
automatically handles dependencies and conflicts. The goal of the project
is to offer open operating systems an easy means to manage large
collections of packages. Most of the system is functional, but some aspects
(mainly the smart-mode) are still being designed.

Note: a few of these features are still subject to alteration.

description: >
  The GNU Binutils are a collection of binary tools. The main ones are:
    * ld - the GNU linker.
    * as - the GNU assembler.
  But they also include:
    * addr2line - Converts addresses into filenames and line numbers.
    * ar - A utility for creating, modifying and extracting from archives.
    * c++filt - Filter to demangle encoded C++ symbols.
    * gprof - Displays profiling information.
    * nlmconv - Converts object code into an NLM.
    * nm - Lists symbols from object files.
    * objcopy - Copys and translates object files.
    * objdump - Displays information from object files.
    * ranlib - Generates an index to the contents of an archive.
    * readelf - Displays information from any ELF format object file.
    * size - Lists the section sizes of an object or archive file.
    * strings - Lists printable strings from files.
    * strip - Discards symbols.
    * windres - A compiler for Windows resource files.
  Most of these programs use BFD, the Binary File Descriptor library, to do low-level manipulation.
  Many of them also use the opcodes library to assemble and disassemble machine instructions.

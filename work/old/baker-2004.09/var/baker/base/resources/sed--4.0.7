brief: SED GNU Stream Editor
description: >
  Sed (streams editor) isn't really a true text editor or text processor.
  Instead, it is used to filter text, i.e., it takes text input and performs
  some operation (or set of operations) on it and outputs the modified text.
  Sed is typically used for extracting part of a file using pattern matching
  or substituting multiple occurances of a string within a file.

brief: General Purpose Parser Generator
description: >
  Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts a grammar description for
  an LALR context-free grammar into a C program to parse that grammar. Once you are
  proficient with Bison, you can use it to develop a wide range of language parsers,
  from those used in simple desk calculators to complex programming languages.
  Bison is upward compatible with Yacc: all properly-written Yacc grammars ought to work
  with Bison with no change. Anyone familiar with Yacc should be able to use Bison with
  little trouble. You need to be fluent in C programming in order to use Bison.

brief: GNU GetText framework for multi-lingual messages
description: >
  GNU `gettext' utilities are a set of tools that provides a framework to help
  other GNU packages produce multi-lingual messages. These tools include a set of
  conventions about how programs should be written to support message catalogs,
  a directory and file naming organization for the message catalogs themselves,
  a runtime library supporting the retrieval of translated messages, and a few
  stand-alone programs to massage in various ways the sets of translatable strings,
  or already translated strings. A special GNU Emacs mode also helps interested parties
  in preparing these sets, or bringing them up to date.

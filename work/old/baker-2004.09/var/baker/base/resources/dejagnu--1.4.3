brief: DejaGnu framework for testing other programs
description: >
  DejaGnu is a framework for testing other programs. Its purpose
  is to provide a single front end for all tests. Think of it as
  a custom library of Tcl procedures crafted to support writing
  a test harness. A test harness is the testing infrastructure
  that is created to support a specific program or tool. Each
  program can have multiple test suites, all supported by a
  single test harness. DejaGnu is written in Expect, which in
  turn uses Tcl.

brief: GNU Shar Utilities
description: >
  GNU shar makes so-called shell archives out of many files, preparing them for transmission
  by electronic mail services. A shell archive is a collection of files that can be unpacked
  by /bin/sh. A wide range of features provide extensive flexibility in manufacturing shars
  and in specifying shar smartness. For example, shar may compress files, uuencode binary
  files, split long files and construct multi-part mailings, ensure correct unsharing order,
  and provide simplistic checksums. GNU unshar scans a set of mail messages looking for the
  start of shell archives. It will automatically strip off the mail headers and other introductory
  text. The archive bodies are then unpacked by a copy of the shell. unshar may also process
  files containing concatenated shell archives.

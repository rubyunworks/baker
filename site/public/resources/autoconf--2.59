brief: Source Code Auto-Configuration Creation Tool
description: >
  Autoconf is an extensible package of m4 macros that produce shell scripts to automatically
  configure software source code packages. These scripts can adapt the packages to many kinds
  of UNIX-like systems without manual user intervention. Autoconf creates a configuration script
  for a package from a template file that lists the operating system features that the package
  can use, in the form of m4 macro calls.

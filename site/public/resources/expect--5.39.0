brief: Tool Automation Utility
description: >
  Expect is a tool for automating interactive applications such as telnet,
  ftp, passwd, fsck, rlogin, tip, etc. Expect really makes this stuff
  trivial. Expect is also useful for testing these same applications.
  And by adding Tk, you can also wrap interactive applications in X11
  GUIs. Expect can make easy all sorts of tasks that are prohibitively
  difficult with anything else. You will find that Expect is an absolutely
  invaluable tool - using it, you will be able to automate tasks that
  you've never even thought of before - and you'll be able to do this
  automation quickly and easily.

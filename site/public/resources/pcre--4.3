brief: PCRE Regular Expression Library
description: >
  The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular expression pattern matching
  using the same syntax and semantics as Perl5. PCRE has its own native API, as well as a
  set of wrapper functions that correspond to the POSIX regular expression API. The PCRE
  library is free, even for building commercial software.

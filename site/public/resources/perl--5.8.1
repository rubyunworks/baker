brief: Perl - Practical Extraction and Report Language
description: >
  Perl is a language optimized for scanning arbitrary text files, extracting information
  from those text files, and printing reports based on that information. It's also a good
  language for many system management tasks. The language is intended to be practical
  (easy to use, efficient, complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal).

brief: GNU Awk utility for modifying files using patterns.
description: >
  If you are like many computer users, you would frequently like to make changes
  in various text files wherever certain patterns appear, or extract data from parts
  of certain lines while discarding the rest. To write a program to do this in a language
  such as C or Pascal is a time-consuming inconvenience that may take many lines of code.
  The job may be easier with `awk'.

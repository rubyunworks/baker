brief: Less File Display Tool
description: >
  Less is a program similar to more, but which allows backward movement in the file as well as forward movement.
  Also, less does not have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large input files it starts up
  faster than text editors like vi. Less uses termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on a variety
  of terminals. There is even limited support for hardcopy terminals.
